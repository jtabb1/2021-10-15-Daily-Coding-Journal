    <p> 
      Yesterday and this morning I made progress on my coding project and ran some errands.  I also saw my future boss 
      this morning and she said that working overtime should 
      not be a problem.  This is something that I am
      interested in doing.

    <p> 
      Today I plan to work on my coding project, pick up my 
      mom from work, and apply to some jobs per my state's 
      unemployment requirements.
